#### What I've learned:
 - More features in DOM. I've leaned about inbuilt Math functions. And use of setTimeout function for delaying certain task in the program.
####  Features:
- Evaluate the total loan amount against your loan amount years and rate of interest
- Calculate monthly EMIs.
- Get Total amount payable.
- Calculate total interest amount.
